Setup complete.
You can now run the hotspot program (it requires root privileges):
  sudo ./myc

This program will:
 - Start NetworkManager and create a hotspot with the provided SSID and password.
 - Continuously monitor internet connectivity using ping.
 - Automatically switch to the best available saved Wi-Fi network if connectivity is lost.
